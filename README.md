## More About Me
I am a Software QA Engineer with a passion for automation and finding ways to break applications. Since January 2022, I have handled 3 client projects and 1 in-house product as the sole QA resource. With the help of my team, I analyzed business requirements and translate them into test scenarios. I've had the pleasure of testing various web and mobile applications - ranging from messaging, ride hailing, ordering, to invoice management systems.

Before I switched to Quality Assurance, I was an Android Developer for 4 1/2 years, using Java and Kotlin. I helped create different kinds of applications - cable subscription management, healthcare facility locator, and online loan application system. I enjoyed testing and debugging these apps and that's when I realized I may be better suited for testing.

In the first 3 years of my career, I worked as a Web Content Specialist. I was responsible for building, loading and updating the IHG websites using CMS. I worked with our stakeholders in Europe to publish hotel promotional campaigns and discounts. As challenging as this experience was, I craved for a role in Software Engineering.

And thus, my journey of continuous learning began. I enrolled myself to a Java training course. I took online courses to learn the best practices in Android development. I also took a seminar on Quality Assurance. Fast forward to today, I am currently learning automation frameworks such as CypressIO, WebdriverIO while practicing different types of testing.

Programming Languages: Typescript, Javascript, Kotlin, Android
Manual Testing: Functional testing, Regression testing, Manual testing, Writing Test scenarios, Bug Reporting, API Testing
Automation Testing: CypressIO, WebdriverIO
Others: Google Cloud Platform, Hasura, Git
OS: MacOS, Windows, ChromeOS

On my free time, I play Genshin Impact. I love the Pokemon franchise, collect trading cards and played several of its games. I'm a big fan of NBA and my favorite team is the Dallas Mavericks since 2003.

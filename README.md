## More About Me
I'm a QA Automation Engineer with strong experience in both manual and automated testing. I work with tools like Playwright, Cypress, WebdriverIO, and Selenium, and I'm confident using JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java for scripting. I also handle REST API testing using Postman and have experience with database testing using MS SQL.

I'm used to working in Agile teams and regularly use Jira, TestRail, Git, and Jenkins or GitHub Actions for test management and CI/CD. My testing approach includes both BDD and TDD, and Iâ€™ve worked across industries like e-commerce, healthcare, transportation, and finance.

Most of my recent work involves designing and maintaining automation frameworks, improving test coverage, and collaborating closely with developers and stakeholders to ensure smooth releases.

Programming Languages: Typescript, Javascript, Kotlin, Android
Manual Testing: Functional testing, Regression testing, Manual testing, Writing Test scenarios, Bug Reporting, API Testing
Automation Testing: CypressIO, WebdriverIO
Others: Google Cloud Platform, Hasura, Git
OS: MacOS, Windows, ChromeOS

On my free time, I play Genshin Impact. I love the Pokemon franchise, collect trading cards and played several of its games. I'm a big fan of NBA and my favorite team is the Dallas Mavericks since 2003.
